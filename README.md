1️⃣ User Interface (UI) Design

UI Design is about how a system looks and how users interact with it.

👉 It focuses on:

Screens

Buttons

Menus

Icons

Layouts

Goal:
Make the system:

Easy to learn

Easy to use

Easy to understand

📌 Example:
Mobile apps like Instagram or WhatsApp have good UI because anyone can use them without training.

2️⃣ Interface Design – Key Questions

A good interface should answer:

Is it easy to learn?

Is it easy to use?

Is it easy to understand?

If users feel confused or stressed, the interface is bad ❌

3️⃣ Typical Design Errors

These are common mistakes in UI design:

Lack of consistency
– Same action works differently on different screens

Too much memorization
– User has to remember many steps or commands

No guidance / help
– No instructions, tooltips, or help button

No context sensitivity
– System doesn’t react based on situation

Poor response
– Slow system, no feedback after clicking

Arcane / unfriendly
– Looks complex, scary, or outdated

📌 Result: Users get frustrated 😤

4️⃣ Golden Rules of User Interface Design

These are rules to design a good UI:

🔹 Place the User in Control

User should feel powerful

Undo, redo, cancel options should exist

🔹 Reduce User’s Memory Load

Don’t make users remember everything

Use icons, menus, suggestions

🔹 Make the Interface Consistent

Same colors, buttons, fonts, layouts everywhere

Example: Save button always in same place

5️⃣ User Interface Design Process

UI design is not one step, it’s a cycle:

Interface Analysis

Task Analysis & Modeling

Interface Design

Interface Construction

Interface Validation

🔁 This process repeats until the UI becomes better.

6️⃣ Interface Analysis

It means understanding before designing.

We study:

Users – Who will use the system?

Tasks – What work will they do?

Content – What information is shown?

Environment – Where & how system is used?

📌 Example:
Designing UI for:

Mobile user ≠ Desktop user

Student ≠ Doctor

7️⃣ Task Analysis and Modeling

Goal: Understand user work in detail.

We ask:

What work will the user perform?

What tasks & subtasks are involved?

What objects will user interact with?

What is the workflow (step-by-step)?

What is the hierarchy of tasks?

Techniques Used:

Use cases – basic interaction flow

Task elaboration – detailed task steps

Object elaboration – interface objects

Workflow analysis – how work is completed

8️⃣ UI Design Patterns – Design Issues

Important issues to handle:

Response time – System should be fast

Help facilities – Help & guidance available

Error handling – Clear error messages

Menu & command labeling – Easy names

Accessibility – For all users (disabled users too)

9️⃣ Mapping User Objectives

This means:
👉 Converting user goals into interface elements

Example:

User goal → “Read information”

UI element → Text, menu, layout

Includes:

Navigation menu

Main content area

Graphics

Header & footer

🔟 Aesthetic Design

This is about look & feel of UI 🎨

Rules:

Don’t fear white space

Emphasize important content

Organize layout top-left to bottom-right

Group related items together

Don’t overload with scrolling

Consider screen resolution & browser size

📌 Good design = Clean + Simple + Attractive

✅ How to End Your Presentation

You can conclude like this:

“User Interface Design plays a crucial role in making systems user-friendly, efficient, and enjoyable. A good UI improves user satisfaction and system usability.”
